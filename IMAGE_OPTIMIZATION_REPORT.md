# Image Optimization and Loading Performance Report

## Current Optimizations Implemented:

### 1. Next.js Image Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- ✅ Enhanced image optimization settings
- ✅ Increased cache TTL to 1 year
- ✅ Proper device and image sizes configured
- ✅ AVIF and WebP format support

### 2. Image Loading Strategies
- ✅ Hero image: `priority` loading with blur placeholder
- ✅ Service cards: `lazy` loading with responsive `sizes`
- ✅ Multiple image carousels: Smart priority for visible images
- ✅ Footer logo: Optimized from PNG to WebP

### 3. Preloading Critical Images
- ✅ Critical images preloaded in HTML head
- ✅ Custom ImagePreloader component for progressive loading
- ✅ Service images preloaded for faster navigation

### 4. Image Optimization Script
- ✅ Enhanced compression (quality 80-85 vs 78)
- ✅ Smart subsample for better compression
- ✅ Responsive image generation for multiple breakpoints
- ✅ Maximum width limits (1920px for performance)

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ OptimizedImage component with fallback support
- ✅ Graceful degradation for missing images

## Deployment Recommendations for Dokploy:

### 1. CDN Configuration
```nginx
# Add to your nginx config or CDN settings
location ~* \.(webp|avif|jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    add_header Vary Accept;
}
```

### 2. Compression
Ensure gzip/brotli compression is enabled for static assets.

### 3. Environment Variables
Add to your Dokploy environment:
```
NEXT_IMAGE_OPTIMIZE=true
NEXT_IMAGE_CACHE_TTL=31536000
```

## Performance Improvements Expected:
- 🚀 40-60% faster image loading
- 📱 Better mobile performance with responsive images
- 🖼️ Reduced layout shift with blur placeholders
- 💾 Better caching with 1-year TTL
- 🔄 Graceful handling of missing images

## File Sizes After Optimization:
Most images are already well-optimized in WebP format, ranging from 9KB to 372KB. The largest images (cocoa.webp, service13.webp, service14.webp) could benefit from further manual optimization if needed.
